Question 1
Before you can effectively code in Java, you need to be able to understand what your code does. Try to solve the following problems in this quiz by hand!

Consider the following BlueJ program.
public class Mystery {
  
  /**
   * read file of mysterious phrases
   */
   
  public void DoSomething() {
    // initialize instance variables
    FileResource someFile = FileResource("phrases.txt");
    for (String phrase : someFile.lines()){
      System.out.println(phrase);
    }
  }
}
Which one of the following is the name of a method?



DoSomething




Correct
2.
Question 2
Consider the following Java class.
public class Thing {
  
  private int a;
  
  public Thing(int x) {
    a = x;
  }
  
  public int geta() {
    return a;
  }
  
  public void print() {
    int b = 4;System.out.println(geta() + " " + b);
  }
}
What is (or are) the instance variable(s) in this class?


a and x



This is not the correct answer. Only variables declared outside the methods are instance variables.

3.
Question 3
Consider the following Java class.

public class Thing {
  
  private int a;
  
  public Thing(int x) {
    a = x;
  }
  
  public int geta() {
    return a;
  }
}
And consider the following code segment that uses the class Thing.

Thing f = new Thing(3);
Thing g = new Thing(5);
Thing h = f;
Thing j = h;
How many Thing objects are created?


2
Correct
A new object is created whenever the new keyword is used.

4.
Question 4
Consider the following code segment that uses the edu.duke FileResource class. The method .length() calculates how many characters are inside a string. For example, for the string "puppy", .length() would calculate a value of 5. We will learn more about strings later in this course.

FileResource f = new FileResource("words.txt");
for (String g : f.lines()) {
  
  if (g.length() > 5) {
    System.out.println(g);
  }
}   
Suppose the file words.txt contains the following lines:

cat

elephant

monkey

tiger

lion

Which one of the following would be the output from this code segment?

Hint: Be sure to review the documentation for FileResource if you do are not sure what this class does or what methods it contains: http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course2/doc/.



elephant

monkey


This is the correct answer. Only words of length greater than five are printed.

5.
Question 5
Consider the Thing class shown below.

public class Thing {
  
  private int a;
  
  public Thing(int x) {
    a = x;
  }
  
  public int geta() {
    return a ;
  }
  
  public void combine (Thing y) {
    a = a + y.geta();
  }
}
And consider the following code segment that uses the Thing class.

Thing f = new Thing(6);
Thing g = new Thing(8);
f.combine(g);
System.out.println(f.geta());
System.out.println(g.geta());
What is printed when this code is executed?


14

8
