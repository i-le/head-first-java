    The first two numbers are the x- and y-coordinates of the upper left corner
    of the imaginary rectangle that encloses the oval. That is, these two numbers
    are the coordinates of the position of the figure drawn by this statement. The
    next two numbers give the width and height of the rectangle containing the

SYNTAX

canvas.drawArc(x, y, Width, Height, StartAngle, ArcAngle);
Draws an arc that is part of an oval placed so the upper left corner of
a tightly enclosing rectangle is at the point (x, y). The ovalâ€™s width and
height are Width and Height, both in pixels. The portion of the arc drawn
is given by StartAngle and ArcAngle, both given in degrees. The rightmost
end of the ovalâ€™s horizontal equator is at 0 degrees. You measure positive
angles in a counterclockwise direction and negative angles in a clockwise
direction. Beginning at StartAngle, you measure ArcAngle degrees along
the oval to form the arc. Figure 1.8 gives some examples of arcs
