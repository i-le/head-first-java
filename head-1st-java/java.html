FAQ1 Why just 0s and 1s?
Computers use 0s and 1s because it is easy to make an electrical device
that has only two stable states. However, when you are programming,
you normally need not be concerned about the encoding of data as 0s
and 1s. You can program as if the computer directly stored numbers,
letters, or strings of characters in memory.
 There is nothing special about calling the states zero and one. We
could just as well use any two names, such as A and B or true and false.
The important thing is that the underlying physical device has two stable
states, such as on and off or high voltage and low voltage. Calling these
two states zero and one is simply a convention, but it’s one that is almost
universally followed.


RECAP Bytes and Memory Locations
A computer’s main memory is divided into numbered units called bytes.
The number of a byte is called its address. Each byte can hold eight
binary digits, or bits, each of which is either 0 or 1. To store a piece of
data that is too large to fit into a single byte, the computer uses several
adjacent bytes. These adjacent bytes are thought of as a single, larger
memory location whose address is the address of the first of the adjacent
bytes.


FAQ What exactly is software?
The word software simply means programs. Thus, a software company
is a company that produces programs. The software on your computer is
just the collection of programs on your computer.

RECAP Compiler
A compiler is a program that translates a program written in a high-level
language, such as Java, into a program in a simpler language that the
computer can more or less directly understand.

RECAP Interpreter
An interpreter is a program that alternates the translation and execution
of statements in a program written in a high-level language.

RECAP Bytecode
The Java compiler translates your Java program into a language called
bytecode. This bytecode is not the machine language for any particular
computer, but it is similar to the machine language of most common
computers. Bytecode is easily translated into the machine language of
a given computer. Each type of computer will have its own translator—
called an interpreter—that translates from bytecode instructions to
machine-language instructions for that computer.

    System.out.println("Hello out there.");
    System.out.println("I will add two numbers for you.");
    System.out.println("Enter two whole numbers on a line:");
        int n1, n2;
    Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
    n1 = keyboard.nextInt();

    System.out.print1n("The sum of those two numbers is");
    System.out.print1n(n1 + n2);
 }

Sample Screen Output 

Hello out there.
I will add two numbers for you.
Enter two whole numbers on a line:
12 30
The sum of those two numbers is
42
