    Variables
Variables in a program are used to store data such as numbers and letters.
They can be thought of as containers of a sort. The number, letter, or other
data item in a variable is called its value. This value can be changed, so that at
one time the variable contains, say, 6, and at another time, after the program
has run for a while, the variable contains a different value, such as 4.
For example, the program in Listing 2.1 uses the variables numberOfBaskets,
eggsPerBasket, and totalEggs8IFOUIJTQSPHSBNJTSVOUIFTUBUFNFOU
eggsPerBasket = 6;
sets the value of eggsPerBasket to 6.

public class EggBasket
{
public static void main(String[] args)
 {
int numberOfBaskets, eggsPerBasket, totalEggs;
 numberOfBaskets = 10;
 eggsPerBasket = 6;
 totalEggs = numberOfBaskets * eggsPerBasket;
 System.out.println("If you have");
 System.out.println(eggsPerBasket + " eggs per basket and");
 System.out.println(numberOfBaskets + " baskets, then");
 System.out.println("the total number of eggs is " + totalEggs);
 }


 the variable is given a value, the value is encoded as a string of 0s and 1s and is
 placed in the variable‚Äôs memory location.
 You should choose variable names that are helpful. The names should
 suggest the variables‚Äô use or indicate the kind of data they will hold. For
 example, if you use a variable to count something, you might name it count.
 If the variable is used to hold the speed of an automobile, you might call the
 variable speed. You should almost never use single-letter variable names like
 x and y. Somebody reading the statement
 x = y + z;
 would have no idea of what the program is really adding. The names of
 variables must also follow certain spelling rules, which we will detail later in
 the section ‚ÄúJava Identifiers.‚Äù
 Before you can use a variable in your program, you must state some basic
 information about each one. The compiler‚Äîand so ultimately the computer‚Äî
 needs to know the name of the variable, how much computer memory to
 reserve for the variable, and how the data item in the variable is to be coded as
 strings of 0s and 1s. You give this information in a variable declaration. Every
 variable in a Java program must be declared before it is used for the first time.
 A variable declaration tells the computer what type of data the variable
 will hold. That is, you declare the variable‚Äôs data type. Since different types
 of data are stored in the computer‚Äôs memory in different ways, the computer
 must know the type of a variable so it knows how to store and retrieve
 the value of the variable from the computer‚Äôs memory. For example, the
 following line from Listing 2.1 declares numberOfBaskets, eggsPerBasket,
 and totalEggs to be variables of data type int:
 int numberOfBaskets, eggsPerBasket, totalEggs;
 A variable declaration consists of a type name, followed by a list of variable
 names separated by commas. The declaration ends with a semicolon. All the
 variables named in the list are declared to have the same data type, as given at
 the start of the declaration.
 If the data type is int, the variable can hold whole numbers, such as 42,
 ‚àí99, 0, and 2001. A whole number is called an integer. The word int is an
 abbreviation of integer. If the type is double, the variable can hold numbers
 having a decimal point and a fractional part after the decimal point. If the
 type is char, the variables can hold any one character that appears on the
 computer keyboard.
 Every variable in a Java program must be declared before the variable can
 be used. Normally, a variable is declared either just before it is used or at the
 start of a section of your program that is enclosed in braces {}. In the simple
 programs we have seen so far, this means that

 RECAP Variable Declarations
In a Java program, you must declare a variable before it can be used.
A variable declaration has the following form:
SYNTAX
Type Variable_1, Variable_2, ...;
EXAMPLES
int styleNumber, numberOfChecks, numberOfDeposits;
double amount, interestRate;
char answer;


REMEMBER Syntactic Variables
When you see something in this book like Type, Variable_1, or Variable_2
used to describe Java syntax, these words do not literally appear in your
Java code. They are syntactic variables, which are a kind of blank that you
fill in with something from the category that they describe. For example,
Type can be replaced by int, double, char, or any other type name.
Variable_1 and Variable_2 can each be replaced by any variable name
