    An if-else statement can contain any sort of statements within it. In
particular, you can nest one if-else statement within another if-else
statement, as illustrated by the following:
if (balance >= 0)
if (INTEREST_RATE >= 0)
 balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;
else
 System.out.println("Cannot have a negative interest.");
else
 balance = balance âˆ’ OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;
If the value of balance is greater than or equal to zero, the entire following
if-else statement is executed:
if (INTEREST_RATE >= 0)
 balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;
else
 System.out.println("Cannot have a negative interest.");
The nested statements can be made clearer by adding braces, as follows:


if (balance >= 0)
{
if (INTEREST_RATE >= 0)
 balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance)/12;
else
 System.out.println("Cannot have a negative interest.");
}
else
 balance = balance âˆ’ OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;
In this case, the braces are an aid to clarity but are not, strictly speaking,
needed.
In other cases, braces are needed. If we omit an else, for example, things
get a bit trickier. The following two statements differ in appearance only in
that one has a pair of braces, but they do not have the same meaning:
//First Version âˆ’ Braces
if (balance >= 0)
{
if (INTEREST_RATE >= 0)
 balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance)/12;
}
else
 balance = balance âˆ’ OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;
//Second Version - No Braces
if (balance >= 0)
if (INTEREST_RATE >= 0)
 balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance)/12;
else
 balance = balance âˆ’ OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;
In an if-else statement, each else is paired with the nearest preceding
unmatched if5IFTFDPOEWFSTJPOÂ‰XJUIPVUCSBDFTÂ‰QBJSTUIFelse with the
second if, despite the misleading indentation. Thus, the meaning is
//Equivalent to Second Version
if (balance >= 0)
{
if (INTEREST_RATE >= 0)
 balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance)/12;
else
 balance = balance OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;
}
To clarify the difference a bit more, consider what happens when balance
is greater than or equal to zero. In the first version, the following action occurs:
if (INTEREST_RATE >= 0)
balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance)/12;

If balance is not greater than or equal to zero in the first version, the following
action is taken instead:
balance = balance âˆ’ OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;
In the second version, if balance is greater than or equal to zero, the following
entire if-else statement is executed:
if (INTEREST_RATE >= 0)
 balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance)/12;
else
 balance = balance âˆ’ OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;
If balance is not greater than or equal to zero in the second version, no action
is taken.
