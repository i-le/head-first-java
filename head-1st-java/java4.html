    RECAP Multibranch if-else Statement
SYNTAX
if (Boolean_Expression_1)
Action_1
else if (Boolean_Expression_2)
Action_2
.

else if (Boolean_Expression_n)
Action_n
else
Default_Action
The actions are Java statements. The boolean expressions are tested
one after the other, starting from the top one. As soon as a boolean
expression is found to be true, the action following that true boolean
expression is executed, and subsequent tests and actions are ignored.
The Default_Action is executed if none of the boolean expressions
is true. Figure 3.8 illustrates the semantics of this form of if-else
statement.
EXAMPLE
if (number < 10)
 System.out.println("number < 10");
else if (number < 50)
 System.out.println("number >= 10 and number < 50");
else if (number < 100)
 System.out.println("number >= 50 and number < 100");
else
 System.out.println("number >= 100.");
