    1. Read houseVolume
2. Read startPopulation
3. population = startPopulation
4. totalBugVolume = population * ONE_BUG_VOLUME
5. countWeeks = 0
6. while (totalBugVolume < houseVolume)
{
 newBugs = population * GROWTH_RATE
 newBugVolume = newBugs * ONE_BUG_VOLUME
 population = population + newBugs
 totalBugVolume = totalBugVolume + newBugVolume
 countWeeks = countWeeks + 1
}
7. %JTQMBZstartPopulation, houseVolume, countWeeks, population, and
totalBugVolume
Our loop simply updates the population of the roaches, the volume of
one bug are both positive numbers, we know that the value of population,
and hence the value of totalBugVolume, will increase with each loop
JUFSBUJPO4PFWFOUVBMMZUIFWBMVFof totalBugVolume will exceed the value of
houseVolume, and the controlling boolean expression
totalBugVolume < houseVolume
will become false and end the while loop.
The variable countWeeks starts out as zero and is increased by 1 on each loop
iteration. Thus, when the loop ends, the value of countWeeks is the total number
of weeks it takes for the volume of roaches to exceed the volume of the house.
Listing 4.3 shows our Java program and sample output.

roaches to completely fill a house from floor to ceiling.
